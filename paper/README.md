# Paper source

Place the LaTeX source of the manuscript in this folder.

Recommended layout:

- `paper/main.tex` (or `paper/strong_path_pagerank.tex`)
- `paper/mybib.bib`
- `paper/figures/` (generated plots or other figures)

The experiment runner saves plots into `outputs/figures/`. Copy the specific PNG/PDF
figures you want to commit into `paper/figures/` (or keep them as build artifacts).
